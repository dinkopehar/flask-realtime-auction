# Aukcije-online

**Aukcije-online** is real time bidding system written in Flask. On backend side, it uses *Flask-SocketIO* for real time changes in bid values. On frontend side, it uses *MaterializeCSS* to display everything in Material design.

Features:
- `Flask-WTF` for form creation and validation
- `Flask-SQLAlchemy` for database access
- `Flask-Admin` for easy control panel over actions on platform
- `Flask-SocketIO` for real time update of values
- `TinyPNG` for compression of profile and article images
- Registration with **reCaptcha** to protect from spam and abuse
- Hashing passwords with **PBKDF2**  to reduce vulnerabilities to brute force attacks
